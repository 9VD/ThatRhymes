# ThatRhymes.com

ThatRhymes.com is a simple, easy-to-use application built with Flask that helps you find rhyming words. You simply enter a word and it returns a list of words that rhyme with the word you provided. It's a great tool for poets, songwriters, and anyone else in need of a bit of linguistic inspiration.

## Features

- **Word Input**: Accepts single-word inputs to generate a list of rhyming words.
- **Large Database**: Uses a large, comprehensive database of English words to find matches.
- **Fast Response**: Designed with performance in mind, providing quick responses to your queries.

## Technologies

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework used to serve the application.
- **Python**: The main programming language for developing the application logic.
